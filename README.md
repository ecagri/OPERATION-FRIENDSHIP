# OPERATION-FRIENDSHIP
This project is developed to get better at using Unity's game engine. Some new features not used in earlier game projects have been added in this project . These include the introduction of one-way platforms, the integration of sound effects and background music to enrich the gaming experience, the utilization of prefabs for more efficient development, the implementation of complex animations to bring characters and interactions to life, the incorporation of projectile motion for engaging ranged combat, and the inclusion of very primitive bots to introduce challenging gameplay dynamics.

**The game is located in the _"Game"_ folder. You can download and test it. Additionally, you can access the source codes in the _"Source Codes"_ folder.**

**Some of the gameplay videos below have been sped up and uploaded in low resolution due to GitHub's size limitations. You can find the full-quality and unaccelerated version of the gameplay video on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ecagric/videos).**
